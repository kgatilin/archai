Total: 30 test functions, 60+ test cases
Total Time: ~2 seconds
```

## Test Design Principles

### Table-Driven Tests
All tests use Go's table-driven test pattern for clarity and maintainability:

```go
tests := []struct {
    name string
    input SomeType
    want ExpectedType
}{
    {name: "case 1", input: ..., want: ...},
    {name: "case 2", input: ..., want: ...},
}

for _, tt := range tests {
    t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
        // test logic
    })
}
```

### Isolated Test Environments
- Unit tests create temporary directories with `t.TempDir()`
- Integration tests use real file system but clean up after
- E2E tests build fresh CLI binaries for each test
- No shared state between tests

### Realistic Test Data
- Go code samples include realistic patterns (services, repositories, DDD concepts)
- Stereotype annotations included in test code
- Both exported and unexported symbols tested
- Edge cases covered (empty packages, root packages, etc.)

### Comprehensive Assertions
Tests verify:
- Success conditions (files created, content correct)
- Error conditions (invalid input, context cancellation)
- Edge cases (empty results, multiple packages)
- Content accuracy (expected symbols present, unexpected symbols absent)

## What's NOT Tested

The following are intentionally excluded or have limited coverage:

1. **D2 Reader** - Not implemented yet (planned for US-3)
2. **Golang Writer** - Not implemented yet (future feature)
3. **Dependency tracking** - Basic tests exist, comprehensive tests deferred
4. **Complex type relationships** - Tested but could be expanded
5. **Performance/load testing** - Not included in unit tests
6. **Concurrent generation** - Single-threaded for now

## Test Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Tests

When adding new features:

1. **Unit tests first** - Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration tests second** - Test component interactions
3. **E2E tests last** - Test user-facing behavior

### Test Organization

```
internal/domain/method_test.go       - Domain model tests
internal/adapter/golang/reader_test.go - Go adapter tests
internal/adapter/d2/[multiple]_test.go - D2 adapter tests
internal/service/generate_test.go    - Service layer tests
internal/integration_test.go         - Integration tests
cmd/archai/e2e_test.go              - End-to-end CLI tests
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
go test ./... -v

# With coverage
go test ./... -cover

# Specific package
go test ./internal/domain -v

# Specific test
go test ./internal/domain -run TestTypeRef_String -v

# With timeout
go test ./... -timeout 60s

# Skip slow tests
go test ./... -short
```

## Conclusion

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of:
- ✅ Domain model helper methods
- ✅ Go code parsing (golang.Reader)
- ✅ D2 diagram generation (d2.Writer)
- ✅ Service orchestration (service.Generate)
- ✅ Full integration flow
- ✅ CLI end-to-end behavior

All tests pass successfully with good code coverage (80-90% in most packages). The test suite follows Go best practices with table-driven tests, isolated environments, and comprehensive assertions.

**Total Test Count:** 30 test functions, 60+ test cases
**Total Execution Time:** ~2 seconds
**Overall Status:** ✅ All tests passing
